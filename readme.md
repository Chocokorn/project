  - I completed a semester project where I was responsible for software testing. I conducted unit testing using Eclipse IDE (JUnit), wrote test scenarios, and assisted      my friends with testing using various tools like Selenium, Apache JMeter, and Postman.

  - I am working on a project for a flight ticket booking system. The system includes functions such as registration, login, searching for airlines, purchasing flight      tickets, processing refunds, managing flights, and providing flight recommendations.
